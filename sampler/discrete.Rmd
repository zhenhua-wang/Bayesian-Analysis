## Beta-Binomial model

Suppose the outcome of each observation is either 1 or 0 according to a unknown parameter $\theta$. This dataset could be modeled as a binomial sampling model.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_1, ..., y_n | \theta \sim Binomial(n, \theta)
\end{aligned}
$$

To find the conjugate prior for $\theta$, we rewrite distribution of sampling model proportional to $\theta$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(y_1, ..., y_n|theta) 
&\propto \theta^{\sum{y_i}} (1-\theta)^{n - \sum{y_i}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Clearly, its conjugate prior belongs to "beta family". (Same as before, we only consider the terms related to $\theta$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\theta) 
&= dbeta(\theta, a, b) \\
&\propto \theta^{a-1}(1-\theta)^{b-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Then, we could compute its posterior distribution easily.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\theta|y_1, ..., y_n) 
&\propto P(y_1, ..., y_n|\theta)P(\theta) \\
&\propto \theta^{\sum{y_i}} (1-\theta)^{n - \sum{y_i}}
\end{aligned}
$$
